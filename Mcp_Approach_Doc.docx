# Approach Document: MCP Client-Server with LLM Command Execution

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview
The **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Client-Server System** integrates with an **LLM (Groq or Ollama)** to dynamically generate and execute system commands. The system consists of three main components:
- **MCP Client**: Sends user queries and displays execution results.
- **MCP Server**: Processes the query, generates a command, executes it, and returns results.
- **LLM Integration**: Uses **Ollama (LLaMA 3.2)** to generate system commands from natural language queries.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ System Architecture
The architecture follows a **client-server model**:

1. **MCP Client (Frontend - Streamlit Web App)**
   - Takes user input (query) via a web interface.
   - Sends request to **MCP Server** via REST API.
   - Displays generated command and execution result.

2. **MCP Server (FastAPI Backend)**
   - Receives query from the client.
   - Uses **LLM (Ollama)** to generate a shell command.
   - Ensures the command is **safe** and compatible with the OS.
   - Executes the command and returns results.
   - Logs all interactions for debugging & auditing.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Features
‚úÖ **Secure Command Execution**
- Blocks dangerous commands (`rm`, `shutdown`, `format`, etc.).
- Uses regex-based filtering to prevent injection attacks.

‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Support**
- Converts Linux commands to Windows equivalents (`ls ‚Üí dir`).
- Ensures compatibility for different OS environments.

‚úÖ **Error Handling & Logging**
- Catches and logs all exceptions.
- Provides meaningful error messages.

‚úÖ **LLM Integration with Ollama**
- Uses **Langchain + Ollama (LLaMA 3.2)** for intelligent command generation.
- Ensures clean command formatting before execution.

‚úÖ **Web-based Frontend (Streamlit)**
- Simple UI to interact with the system.
- Displays both **generated command** and **execution output**.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Security Considerations üîê
- **Input Validation**: Ensures user input is safe before sending to LLM.
- **Whitelisting**: Restricts execution to **safe** commands only.
- **Command Sanitization**: Removes special characters and unnecessary formatting.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Logs every query, command, and execution result.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Strategy üöÄ
### Local Development:
- Uses `uvicorn` to run **FastAPI server** locally.
- The **Streamlit frontend** runs as a separate process.
- Ollama runs as a local model server.

### Production Deployment:
- Deploy backend as a containerized FastAPI service (Docker).
- Use **Gunicorn + Uvicorn workers** for scalability.
- Host the frontend on **Streamlit Cloud or a FastAPI web UI**.
- Ensure **HTTPS & authentication** for security.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps üîÑ
- ‚úÖ **Automated Testing**: Add test cases for different OS environments.
- ‚úÖ **Enhance LLM Accuracy**: Fine-tune command generation.
- ‚úÖ **Improve UI/UX**: Add real-time logs, command history, and error reporting.
- ‚úÖ **Containerization**: Provide a Dockerfile for easy deployment.
